      "Output text: 0.28 --> undefined this is the new Rolls-Royce Spectre and  2.159 --> undefined could it be a bit like when David  3.6 --> undefined Beckham met Victoria Adams you know a  6.48 --> undefined match made in heaven you see what youve  8.36 --> undefined got there is the luxury of Rolls-Royce  10.639 --> undefined combined with silent effortless  12.799 --> undefined luxurious electric propulsion or could  15.08 --> undefined it work out a little bit more like when  16.68 --> undefined Brad Pit hooked up with Angelina Jolie  19.08 --> undefined and turned into a bit of a disaster well  21.56 --> undefined in this video were going to find out  22.68 --> undefined whether the rollsroyce Spectre is more  24.359 --> undefined Posh and Beck or brangelina now to do  26.76 --> undefined that what Im going to do is check out  28.279 --> undefined the exterior design  30.599 --> undefined talk you through the interior so thats  32.279 --> undefined a shame see how practical it is sorry  34.8 --> undefined Rolls-Royce please let me a car again  36.84 --> undefined Im going to tell you whats good about  38 --> undefined this car whats not so good about this  40.719 --> undefined car its a little bit soft Im going to  42.52 --> undefined take it for a drive everyones going to  44.239 --> undefined hate me and of course Im going to  45.6 --> undefined launch it to see how quick it is from  46.96 --> undefined not to 60 M hour that is Progressive  49.719 --> undefined thrust Im also going to get into a few  51.079 --> undefined scrapes with it as well yeah Im out  53.32 --> undefined Watson youre watching  57.48 --> undefined carwow lets start this video by talking  59.719 --> undefined about the design of the Rolls-Royce  61.399 --> undefined Spectre its a wide car but they havent  63.719 --> undefined overdone it with design features very  66.2 --> undefined simplistic very elegant I really like  68.64 --> undefined the look of these protruding tail lipes  71.479 --> undefined less get on the fact that they have  73.119 --> undefined condensation in them lets see if the  74.799 --> undefined other one does as  77.24 --> undefined well oh dear lets lets move on around  79.52 --> undefined the side quick quick quick quick quick  80.759 --> undefined anyhow got to say this OB paint looks  83.119 --> undefined amazing or they wouldnt be everyones  84.96 --> undefined cup of tea I like it though I like the  86.72 --> undefined big wheels as well they start at 22 in  89.28 --> undefined these are the 23s and I love  91.439 --> undefined rolls-royces thick center cap so they  93.799 --> undefined actually stay upright when the car is  95.64 --> undefined driving along now just check it out  97.88 --> undefined inside profile it looks beautiful and  100.68 --> undefined huge it measures 5 1/2 M long and I love  104.36 --> undefined the coach line so this is painted by  106.719 --> undefined Human by hand and just check this out  108.84 --> undefined check this out that lines up perfectly  111.64 --> undefined absolutely  113.04 --> undefined perfectly its insane love the shiny  115.52 --> undefined bits of trim around the windows these  117.56 --> undefined are the biggest doors on any rolls look  120.2 --> undefined at that absolutely  121.92 --> undefined massive and if you want you can have  124 --> undefined this silver Bonnet its quite nice with  125.6 --> undefined the silver Bonnet at the front here you  127.479 --> undefined have the daytime running lights on top  129.319 --> undefined the main headlight unit below I think  131.56 --> undefined that was a design feature that was first  133.56 --> undefined started on the citrum Picasso MPV but  136.12 --> undefined looks really good on this rolls and you  137.76 --> undefined got the widest Grill of any Rolls-Royce  139.92 --> undefined and oh  141.319 --> undefined yes thats actually hurting my fingers  143.599 --> undefined because thats real authentic metal not  146.28 --> undefined like a fake metal grill that you get on  148.36 --> undefined a Bentley  151.84 --> undefined what is fake though is this you dont  153.4 --> undefined need that Grill look car stick of truth  156.04 --> undefined I just put it in there quite gingerly  157.48 --> undefined there we go look its blanked out behind  161 --> undefined there the grill isnt grilling the  163.48 --> undefined actual cooling of the battery and stuff  164.8 --> undefined is done through some vents in there  166.4 --> undefined which can open and close when the  167.8 --> undefined batteries need cooling speaking of which  170.36 --> undefined its absolutely huge the battery pack on  172.08 --> undefined this car weighs in over 700 Kos which  174.4 --> undefined means that even though this is like a  176 --> undefined coupe Rolls-Royce its almost 250 kg  179.36 --> undefined heavier than the massive Rolls-Royce  181.56 --> undefined Phantom 4 seater limousine its also got  183.64 --> undefined a very massive charging port flap and I  185.84 --> undefined would have thought that maybe it would  187.799 --> undefined have been like electrically operated  189.76 --> undefined rather than having to operate it by hand  191.2 --> undefined to open  192.92 --> undefined it anyway that brings me onto the  194.92 --> undefined battery itself the Spectre has a usable  197.4 --> undefined battery capacity of 102 KW hours and  200.319 --> undefined according to Rolls-Royce thats good  201.72 --> undefined enough for a range of 329 miles but I  204.68 --> undefined wanted to test that out for myself so I  206.48 --> undefined fully charged the car and the trip  207.879 --> undefined computer said that will give me a range  209.319 --> undefined of 2 271 Mi anyway Im barked on my  212.68 --> undefined journey and it took me 261 Mi and I  215.48 --> undefined still had 11 M of range remaining which  217.599 --> undefined meant a total possible of 272 M on a  220.959 --> undefined full charge so it means that trick  222.64 --> undefined computer is pretty accurate and that I  224.4 --> undefined achieved 83% of rolls-royces claimed  227.36 --> undefined range however things arent that simple  229.04 --> undefined with these electric cars you see while  231.239 --> undefined the trick computer may get to a point  232.72 --> undefined where it says youre out of range with  234 --> undefined no Mars remaining you do often have  235.76 --> undefined about 10 or so extra Mars available as a  238.879 --> undefined safety net so if I was to include those  242 --> undefined you could say this call do over like 280  244.4 --> undefined miles on a full charge before it will  246.319 --> undefined concave and in fact when you look at my  248.28 --> undefined average energy consumption of 2.8 m per  250.879 --> undefined kwatt hour multiply that up by the  252.48 --> undefined battery of 102 kwatt hours then youre  254.56 --> undefined looking at a real world possible range  256.28 --> undefined of about  257.28 --> undefined 286 Mi and interestingly the trick  259.84 --> undefined computer is now saying 291 Mi on a full  262.68 --> undefined charge also I should point out that most  264.4 --> undefined of my miles were done a Motorway speeds  266.84 --> undefined where electric cars arent that  268.24 --> undefined efficient so its not completely  269.72 --> undefined plausible that this car should be able  271.039 --> undefined to break the 300 M Mark if youre very  273.4 --> undefined very careful when driving it welcome to  275.52 --> undefined the inside of the Rolls-Royce Spectre  277.199 --> undefined and the first thing I want to show you  278.16 --> undefined is this the car is the very first  279.639 --> undefined Rolls-Royce to have fully digital dials  281.759 --> undefined but I think theyve done them in a very  283 --> undefined sympathetic way that looks lovely  285.199 --> undefined doesnt it now youve got a main  286.4 --> undefined infotainment screen here which is based  288.16 --> undefined on the BMW system its reasonably easy  290.52 --> undefined to  291.28 --> undefined navigate its absolutely fine and then  293.88 --> undefined moving over here theres something you  295 --> undefined dont get on a BMW and its the special  297.639 --> undefined Spectre graphic here and that this of  300.039 --> undefined like Galaxy thing going on now this  302.08 --> undefined isnt painted on these are loads of  303.479 --> undefined little holes that are like punched  304.96 --> undefined through some wood and behind there you  307.28 --> undefined have some lights so its actually  309.039 --> undefined illuminated that is insane to whats  311.759 --> undefined also insane look at  313.36 --> undefined this thats solid metal their events  316.8 --> undefined feels so so expensive so do all the  319.199 --> undefined switches and buttons oh yeah thats  322.16 --> undefined satisfying Everything feels really nice  324.4 --> undefined to move and to  326.16 --> undefined touch wait a minute whats that apart  329.24 --> undefined from that oh no whats going on there so  331.24 --> undefined thats a shame so this is a real cheap  333.52 --> undefined feeding bit of plastic the kind of thing  334.96 --> undefined youd expect to find on something like a  336.4 --> undefined daa not a Rolls Roy they tried to cover  338.72 --> undefined it up a bit by putting leather on the  341.039 --> undefined stalk and stitching it it doesnt really  343.24 --> undefined work cuz you dont touch that part you  344.6 --> undefined touch that part and actually the leather  346.24 --> undefined makes it look like something a little  347.8 --> undefined bit rude that Im not going to  349.479 --> undefined mention theres another cheap feeling  351.56 --> undefined bit of material in here and its the  352.96 --> undefined vanity  354.52 --> undefined mirror everything else is just lovely  356.96 --> undefined like the diffuse light from there this  358.8 --> undefined the grab handle the lighting area up  361.4 --> undefined here everything else that you touch its  364.36 --> undefined just so gorgeous and special feeling me  367.88 --> undefined I love it I love the door handles up  369.919 --> undefined here and like the metal strip that you  371.599 --> undefined get and you just touch that as you  373.759 --> undefined reaching the door handle it just adds a  375.599 --> undefined feeling of luxury quality to this car  378.88 --> undefined one thing I find quite weird though is  380.12 --> undefined that you sit really quite low in it  382.16 --> undefined makes me feel short because the dash is  384.599 --> undefined quite tall and quite Bluff upright now  387.24 --> undefined you can of course jack up your sink  389.12 --> undefined quite a long  390.479 --> undefined way I thought that the actual electric  393.44 --> undefined motors in the seats would be a bit  394.599 --> undefined quieter see as this is a Rolls-Royce I  396.68 --> undefined me just check the windows thats better  398.919 --> undefined thats quiet the electric window motor  400.84 --> undefined is definitely quiet yeah like that you  404.28 --> undefined can also move the steering wheel of  408.12 --> undefined course thats not so quiet either is it  411.96 --> undefined h oh well lets check out storage spaces  415.96 --> undefined oh yeah this is all lined with thought  417.56 --> undefined it feels nice you got wiress charging  419.039 --> undefined there USB VCS and 12vt socket it EDG  421.8 --> undefined down there theres a little place here  423.919 --> undefined for your keys you got the controller  426.72 --> undefined there for the infotainment system if  428.36 --> undefined youd rather rotate and push rather than  430.599 --> undefined touchy touchy on the screen back to the  432.879 --> undefined storage you got your cup holders there  434.96 --> undefined and just look at the damping on this oh  438.08 --> undefined that feels so solid and expensive really  441.28 --> undefined really nice lets check out the glove  444.24 --> undefined box oh nicely damped as well its not  447.56 --> undefined the biggest but its large enough  450.319 --> undefined oh I just have another G  452.96 --> undefined that as for the door  455.08 --> undefined bins well they not the largest I do have  459.56 --> undefined a bottle in here and let me just see if  461.52 --> undefined I can get a larger  464.12 --> undefined bottle cuz rollsroyce drivers still want  466.599 --> undefined to drink there we go look you can fit a  468.68 --> undefined large bottle in there I take it all back  472.28 --> undefined decent  473.319 --> undefined size can it fit the larger  475.96 --> undefined bottle this is make or break for  477.919 --> undefined Rolls-Royce oh yeah there we go this  480.28 --> undefined cars bound to be a roaring success now  483.919 --> undefined potential customers have breathed a sigh  486.24 --> undefined of relief there is one problem I  487.8 --> undefined actually find with these door bins you  489.039 --> undefined probably noticed it then they go back a  490.96 --> undefined little way so theres been a few times  493 --> undefined that Ive been out in this car and Ive  494.44 --> undefined like looked down there my wallet in  496 --> undefined there no its not and I got out the car  498.039 --> undefined then I realized my wallet isnt with me  499.36 --> undefined so then I have to come back and just  500.56 --> undefined check down back there look look look  502.639 --> undefined look let me show you look  504.8 --> undefined phone can you see my phone no you cant  506.919 --> undefined its gone in it its disappeared no  508.36 --> undefined phone in there its all the way back  510.599 --> undefined there oh do you know what can you hear  513.159 --> undefined that noise Ive just hit the button to  515.44 --> undefined activate the seat massaging in fact  517.08 --> undefined theres so many options on this car in  518.88 --> undefined terms of seat massaging you can massage  520.839 --> undefined your lower legs your back your buttocks  524.039 --> undefined you can also alter all the heating of  525.64 --> undefined the steering wheel and the armrests and  527.6 --> undefined you can alter how the seating actually  529.04 --> undefined warms your body whether its more on  530.48 --> undefined your legs or more on your back its  531.88 --> undefined quite incredible really in fact the  533.519 --> undefined ability to completely Speck this car up  535.399 --> undefined and make it completely bespoke for  537.16 --> undefined yourself is also incredible so if you  538.959 --> undefined dont like this this kind of obene cream  541.92 --> undefined I do actually you can go for something  543.64 --> undefined completely different maybe louder maybe  545.519 --> undefined less in your face one last thing I want  547.12 --> undefined to show you its the doors so to open  549.68 --> undefined the door I pull that and itll open  551.68 --> undefined there and then to actually open it  553 --> undefined further I pull again and it opens  555.48 --> undefined electrically though you do have to hold  557.48 --> undefined the handle so that it doesnt  558.6 --> undefined automatically open into a passer by to  561.16 --> undefined shut it I just press on the brake like  563.12 --> undefined this look B come  566.04 --> undefined on now if I wanted to do it differently  568.399 --> undefined I could just pull up on this switch and  569.8 --> undefined Ill show you now by shutting the  571.76 --> undefined passenger door without having to reach  573.64 --> undefined across tole  576.48 --> undefined pip one other thing I want to show you  578.399 --> undefined about the doors is look you got  580.88 --> undefined frameless  583.279 --> undefined Windows  585.079 --> undefined a thats just so cool go have a look  588.92 --> undefined from further away I love cars when you  591.56 --> undefined can put both windows down you dont have  593.68 --> undefined the frame dividing them Coupe now lets  596.72 --> undefined see what space is like here in the back  599.04 --> undefined of the Spectre obviously its a twodo  602.12 --> undefined coupe so you have to move the front  603.88 --> undefined passenger seat out of the  605.48 --> undefined way yeah as twodo Coupes go its not  608.959 --> undefined particularly difficult to get into the  610.2 --> undefined rear I think if you were on the large  612.68 --> undefined side you might struggle but adults will  614.64 --> undefined be okay check out knee room so this seat  617.12 --> undefined will go back to my driving position knee  619.16 --> undefined room is fine foot space come look at the  621.44 --> undefined foot space thats really good as well  624.76 --> undefined and  626 --> undefined Headroom its a bit tight people over  628.079 --> undefined six foot might struggle but I do like  629.839 --> undefined the fact that these seat backs are quite  631.24 --> undefined reclined so its comfy back here and  633.12 --> undefined like in the front its just a luxurious  635.48 --> undefined place to be with all the you know shiny  637.88 --> undefined bits and pieces the lovely bits of trim  640.16 --> undefined oh incidentally you can have this in a  642.279 --> undefined kind of Starry effect yeah we got some  644.639 --> undefined storage into here which is a good job  647.32 --> undefined because there are no door bins at all  649.519 --> undefined you got your two USB Cs there for  651.839 --> undefined charging your mobile phones we got cup  654.24 --> undefined holders under here oh that feels  656.44 --> undefined expensive yes lovely cup holders and  659.079 --> undefined then you got your climate control  660.44 --> undefined buttons here and  662.399 --> undefined more metalness comfortable enough for a  665.32 --> undefined twodo coupe oh and look got ice fix  668.8 --> undefined anger points there now I actually fitted  671 --> undefined a babysit into this car and it was easy  673.04 --> undefined enough to get it in the problem was  675.279 --> undefined trying to get to the eyes fix ankle  677.44 --> undefined points because these flaps are slightly  679.8 --> undefined offset to the middle so you end up  681.76 --> undefined stretching the flaps not to get to the  684.48 --> undefined actual mounting point but my little  686.399 --> undefined daughter Grace absolutely loved  688.079 --> undefined traveling in the back of this rolls  689.639 --> undefined though she has left her mark look grubby  692.959 --> undefined child por prints I think that if she was  696.279 --> undefined a bit older she might have gotten her  697.92 --> undefined mothers nerves a bit by pressing this  699.8 --> undefined button here really handy for adults but  702.8 --> undefined children might use it to just alter the  704.48 --> undefined seating position of their parents like  706.24 --> undefined that there you go you know thats going  708.68 --> undefined to happen now lets check out the boot  710.959 --> undefined you have 380 L of space and to put that  714.6 --> undefined into context a Volkswagen golfs boot is  716.88 --> undefined the same size obviously with the  718.6 --> undefined Volkswagen Golf you have the added  719.88 --> undefined practicality of been able to fold the  721.16 --> undefined seats down which you cant in here still  726.32 --> undefined you do have it lined with lovely carpet  729.8 --> undefined and I think its large enough to fit a  731.399 --> undefined man in it  733.48 --> undefined man be careful not to scratch the paint  736.76 --> undefined workor go  741.44 --> undefined on do you reckon theres room for me in  744.12 --> undefined there uh yeah thats Id rather there  748.36 --> undefined wasnt but might be D that sounded  751.399 --> undefined Sinister um do I can fit in there as  754 --> undefined well how are we going to do this top to  757.16 --> undefined tail sorry Rolls-Royce please let me a  759.8 --> undefined car  760.28 --> undefined [Music]  761.639 --> undefined again Louis and you can shut the what  764.959 --> undefined Im not sure this is the right way round  766.959 --> undefined especially if you  768.32 --> undefined fart go for it  771.12 --> undefined leis J we going to  777.48 --> undefined fit oh  781.44 --> undefined it we fitted once that test complete you  784.04 --> undefined cant fit two men in there oh and  786.639 --> undefined actually yeah jump out a second James  789.92 --> undefined oh oh hold me  792.079 --> undefined legs right try not to SC the paint  797.6 --> undefined work watch yourself watch your belt on  800.56 --> undefined the the paint the shiny bits and dont  803.32 --> undefined forget your glasses actually very nice  805.839 --> undefined James right  807.56 --> undefined so thats where you have your storage  810 --> undefined cables and rubbish and mini  814.36 --> undefined cheddar I think theyre  816.8 --> undefined Graces its okay though because we do  818.959 --> undefined have some more storage in the front  821.56 --> undefined underneath here being an electric car  823.199 --> undefined you have a wonderful front boot its  826.079 --> undefined obviously under this rather expensive  827.68 --> undefined feeling metal cover up right oh wait a  831.639 --> undefined minute um doesnt look like its meant  833.48 --> undefined to be a front boot so looks like we got  836.56 --> undefined some more mini cheddar here  842.639 --> undefined I didnt put those there anyway that  844.279 --> undefined brings on to five annoying things about  846 --> undefined the Rolls-Royce Spectre sometimes when  848.44 --> undefined youre parked on a slight angle like I  850.6 --> undefined am now the door Motors wont work so you  852.88 --> undefined have to do it all manually  857.04 --> undefined and its a big old heavy door look its  860.8 --> undefined not operating when I press the brake to  862.199 --> undefined shut it let just try  866.48 --> undefined again no look door Drive restricted its  869.959 --> undefined not that much of an angle the climate  872.56 --> undefined control system in this car is a little  874.399 --> undefined bit quaint but you could say its  875.92 --> undefined Antiquated because rather than setting  877.92 --> undefined an exact temperature and the car just  879.639 --> undefined gets the car to that temperature for you  881.399 --> undefined you have this dial here so hotter or  884.24 --> undefined colder now in the front theyre split so  886.24 --> undefined you can mix and match the temperature  888.92 --> undefined the upper part of the car and the lower  890.959 --> undefined part the only thing is though it doesnt  892.92 --> undefined actually work that well if you have like  894.92 --> undefined upper hot and lower cold you never  897.32 --> undefined really get the top half hot and a top  899.44 --> undefined half cold likewise the other way around  901.44 --> undefined if you really want it very hot or very  902.92 --> undefined cold you do have to slide them both  904.72 --> undefined together I mean I should be thankful  906.199 --> undefined that we dont have buttons all p in the  908.56 --> undefined menu on the screen but it just doesnt  910.639 --> undefined work that well for me and then theres  912.12 --> undefined the blower fan speed because yes I know  914.32 --> undefined they probably want diffuse air in a  916.72 --> undefined Rolls-Royce but yeah look at that its a  919.48 --> undefined little bit soft sometimes you just want  921.32 --> undefined to be blown hard and this car wont do  923.199 --> undefined it for you rolls-royces are all about  925.399 --> undefined luxury and comfort and again that extra  926.959 --> undefined mile to make their car seem more refined  928.759 --> undefined than any other normal vehicle yet they  930.92 --> undefined somehow havent managed to fix the  932.6 --> undefined creaky brakes that you get on many  933.88 --> undefined electric cars especially from the rear  936.36 --> undefined brakes I listen to this it does it just  938 --> undefined the same as the cheapest electric  944.12 --> undefined car you shouldnt have it on a  945.759 --> undefined Rolls-Royce I can just about accept it  948 --> undefined on some cheap daer spring or something  950.24 --> undefined like that but a rollsroyce come on you  953.44 --> undefined got some very thick windscreen pillars  955.36 --> undefined which do create a bit of a blind spot  959.36 --> undefined but thats not the worst bit because you  961.399 --> undefined sit quite low that plus the position of  963.959 --> undefined these rather large door mirrors do  966.199 --> undefined create a worst blind spot and Ive  967.92 --> undefined noticed its really problematic when  969.24 --> undefined youre approaching a roundabout and you  970.6 --> undefined want to filter straight onto it but you  972.16 --> undefined need to look to your right to make sure  973.319 --> undefined theres no cars coming from the side so  975.639 --> undefined have a look at this Im going to  977.319 --> undefined disappear ready Ive gone where am I  980.72 --> undefined nowhere to be seen absolutely nowhere to  982.72 --> undefined be seen Im actually here hello hello  986.8 --> undefined crazy many electric cars in emit a  989.44 --> undefined synthetic noise to make it for the fact  991.279 --> undefined they dont have a normal engine noise  993.44 --> undefined and this Rolls-Royce is no different  995.12 --> undefined theyre not convinced by the noise that  997.24 --> undefined Rolls-Royce have gone for  1000.18 --> undefined [Music]  1003.16 --> undefined listen its the kind of noise that they  1005.44 --> undefined use in thriller movies just before  1008.199 --> undefined something bad is about to happen so it  1010.6 --> undefined sort of makes it feel a bit tense which  1013 --> undefined is the exact opposite of what a  1015.16 --> undefined Rolls-Royce should be about at least you  1017.959 --> undefined can turn it off by pressing a button on  1019.68 --> undefined here and that brings on to five good  1021 --> undefined things about this car because there are  1022.44 --> undefined some noises I do like such as this the  1025.079 --> undefined indicator  1030.36 --> undefined click its like the tick of an expensive  1033.88 --> undefined clock the Lambs W mats in this car so  1036.72 --> undefined thick and luxurious oh kind of makes you  1039.16 --> undefined want to go barefoot though I wouldnt go  1040.919 --> undefined barefoot as a driver not for safety  1042.72 --> undefined reasons just because the design of the  1044.6 --> undefined mat for the driver sort of weirds me out  1047.64 --> undefined Ive been staring at it thinking what  1048.919 --> undefined then what does that remind me of I dont  1050.4 --> undefined know what it is s of reminds me of a  1052.2 --> undefined gorilla bare chest that a gorilla has  1054.12 --> undefined and theyre like furry elsewhere  1055.72 --> undefined definitely  1061.24 --> undefined is for the Spectre Rolls-Royce have now  1063.799 --> undefined redesigned the spirit of ecstasy of is  1065.919 --> undefined slightly hello how you doing her wings  1067.559 --> undefined are now slightly more back swept to  1069.64 --> undefined reduce drag cuz every bit helps an  1071.6 --> undefined electric car its also illuminated  1073.72 --> undefined though you cant see it in the daylight  1074.88 --> undefined so come and have a look down my top  1076.72 --> undefined sounds Sinister but there we go have a  1078.28 --> undefined look can you see get in  1081.2 --> undefined there its a bit rude is it oh oh get  1084.24 --> undefined out you filthy bugger do you see that  1087.24 --> undefined also as before another Rolls-Royce  1089.039 --> undefined products you can make the spirit go away  1092.6 --> undefined you can make it  1094.32 --> undefined return and of course if some grubby  1097.32 --> undefined Thief tries to steal  1099.44 --> undefined it that happens you can get the car with  1102.2 --> undefined rolls-royces famous Starlight headliner  1104.799 --> undefined so it has over 5,000 individual LEDs and  1108 --> undefined you can have any Star constellation you  1109.96 --> undefined want so a lot of people would choose the  1111.76 --> undefined one over wherever their main residences  1114.52 --> undefined I say main cuz obviously theyre going  1115.559 --> undefined to have a few properties this one is  1117.4 --> undefined apparently the constellation over the  1119.36 --> undefined Goodwood Factory one of the cool things  1121.559 --> undefined about this is that you get these  1122.88 --> undefined occasional shooting stars and theyre  1125 --> undefined really handy if you got young children  1127.12 --> undefined you see I went on a long journey in this  1128.64 --> undefined cold my daughter Grace and instead of  1130.52 --> undefined having to play I Spy for the entire  1132.48 --> undefined journey I just got to play a game shout  1134.679 --> undefined out when you see a shooting star and it  1137.2 --> undefined kept to entertain the whole way P rolls  1139.84 --> undefined the specters cameras sensors and satinav  1142.84 --> undefined data is linked to its suspension so when  1144.64 --> undefined youre driving down the road it can  1145.84 --> undefined gauge the surface and if it needs to  1147.72 --> undefined slacken off the dampers to make it just  1149.76 --> undefined absorb the bump a little bit better also  1152.2 --> undefined it can decouple its anti-roll bars when  1153.88 --> undefined youre going straight so that they dont  1155.52 --> undefined cause the car to rock from side to side  1157.4 --> undefined when you go over a bump and when you go  1158.76 --> undefined into a corner theyll lock back up again  1160.76 --> undefined so it keeps it nice and flat in the  1162.12 --> undefined bends and also it can alter the damping  1164.44 --> undefined and air suspension on each side of the  1165.76 --> undefined car to keep it nice and flat through the  1167.2 --> undefined turns and well find out exactly how all  1169.12 --> undefined of that works now to take it for a drive  1171.48 --> undefined want to sell your car quickly easily and  1173.72 --> undefined for a fair price then head to car while  1175.88 --> undefined to have over 4,000 trusted dealers ready  1178.84 --> undefined to bid on it in an online auction first  1181.52 --> undefined enter your cars registration to get an  1183.52 --> undefined instant approximate valuation then if  1186.24 --> undefined you want to proceed give us some more  1188.12 --> undefined details and upload some photos and well  1190.4 --> undefined help you set a fair reserve price for  1192.2 --> undefined your car thats the minimum amount youd  1194.159 --> undefined be happy to sell it for once youve done  1196.159 --> undefined that well enter your car into an online  1198.32 --> undefined auction when the auctions over well  1200.28 --> undefined let you know the result and the dealer  1201.84 --> undefined with the winning bid will be in touch to  1203.6 --> undefined arrange easy payment and free collection  1206.28 --> undefined of your car 93% of sellers surveyed said  1210.28 --> undefined they got the price they expected or more  1212.919 --> undefined through carwow the best bit is its  1216.799 --> undefined completely free I put a link in the  1219.36 --> undefined description of this video and the Ping  1221.36 --> undefined comment to take you directly to carw  1223.84 --> undefined where over 4,000 dealers are ready to  1226.679 --> undefined bid on your car or you can just click on  1228.84 --> undefined pop out Banner that should be appearing  1230.4 --> undefined in the top right hand corner of the  1231.559 --> undefined screen now alternatively just Google  1234.24 --> undefined help me carwow and we will help you sell  1236.919 --> undefined your car quickly easily and for a fair  1239.4 --> undefined price on with the video one of the  1241.08 --> undefined problems with driving something like  1242.6 --> undefined this Rolls-Royce BR smaller Villages is  1245.32 --> undefined the sheer width of it so its over 2 m  1248.4 --> undefined excluding the door mirror so people do  1250.64 --> undefined have to pull over to get out of your way  1253.039 --> undefined let me just bring up the cameras cuz I  1254.48 --> undefined do not want to  1256.799 --> undefined scrape oh this is not good but Im not  1259.28 --> undefined enjoying this you sit quite low as well  1261.88 --> undefined so the view out and KN where the corners  1264.799 --> undefined of the car are is a little bit tricky  1268.32 --> undefined okay well I do think Ive got away with  1270.48 --> undefined that by not having too many cars coming  1272.52 --> undefined in the other direction oh no wait for me  1276.799 --> undefined please Im in the Rolls-Royce thank you  1279.32 --> undefined fellow electric car driver Ill tell you  1281.559 --> undefined what though while there might be moments  1283.679 --> undefined of concern when driving through a  1285.64 --> undefined village most of the time its super  1287.52 --> undefined relaxing so quiet in here the suspension  1291 --> undefined is absolutely glorious this bit of road  1294.08 --> undefined is horrible really in terms of the  1296.4 --> undefined condition and yet this just just soaks  1300.44 --> undefined at the bumps lets get the parking thing  1302.52 --> undefined on see if I can find a parking space  1305.32 --> undefined there we go start reverse parking lets  1307.12 --> undefined see what it does in this situation is it  1309.48 --> undefined really going to do this or is it just  1310.919 --> undefined going to park it in the weirdest way  1312.919 --> undefined possible as it figured out that theres  1314.88 --> undefined a low curb  1319.12 --> undefined it  1320.919 --> undefined misinterpreted this as a parking bait  1323.799 --> undefined dont crash into the  1328.48 --> undefined wall I think its as bad at parking as  1331 --> undefined me this is just what it  1338.08 --> undefined doing yay thats perfectly fine I think  1341.88 --> undefined I better get out this space cuz Im sort  1343.48 --> undefined of blocking the road to be fair on this  1345.6 --> undefined rollsroyce it did spot that as a Bay  1347.679 --> undefined Park even though wasnt one and I did  1349.72 --> undefined select for it to go into the bay so my  1351.72 --> undefined fault not really the cars oh hello we  1354.559 --> undefined got Bay Park in here now it wants to Bay  1356.559 --> undefined Park in a here Ive got someone behind  1361.36 --> undefined me theyre not going to move oh they are  1363.72 --> undefined going to move sometimes people move for  1365.559 --> undefined rolls-royces oh Im causing chaos here  1367.72 --> undefined everyones very cross at me Im trying  1369.88 --> undefined to park the car shes really annoyed  1372.4 --> undefined dont know what shes going to do try  1373.6 --> undefined not to crash into the Rolls-Royce its  1375.279 --> undefined wanting to partk me here I cause chaos  1378.2 --> undefined again again everyones going to hate me  1380.4 --> undefined cant blame them right this is oh is not  1384.64 --> undefined happy I dont really know if this is a  1386.799 --> undefined good idea once again I chose to do that  1388.96 --> undefined it selected a space it wasnt the right  1390.72 --> undefined space I mean I guess I can sort of Park  1392.96 --> undefined here lets just get out of here so the  1394.799 --> undefined length of this thing does affect the  1396.4 --> undefined maneuverability even though I have rear  1398.919 --> undefined axle steering its not easy to do a  1402.159 --> undefined uturn in a car this size i normally do  1404.44 --> undefined it here but Im kind of a bit scuppered  1406.6 --> undefined by this van so lets just try it up  1408.72 --> undefined there so the Turning circles 12.7 M  1412.2 --> undefined lets see if we can get around here  1414.159 --> undefined definitely using my cameras will I get  1416.08 --> undefined backround again absolutely no bluming  1419.279 --> undefined chance Im doing all the wrong Maneuvers  1424.84 --> undefined here very close to that old perso and no  1429.72 --> undefined I give this car one thing it might be  1431.919 --> undefined big it might not have the best turning  1433.96 --> undefined Circle but my gosh its easy to turn  1436.72 --> undefined this steering wheel and normally if I  1439 --> undefined was getting into these kind of shenan  1440.4 --> undefined guns in any other car Id start to get a  1442.159 --> undefined little bit stressed but this car is so  1444.279 --> undefined relaxing I dont mind so much sometimes  1446.88 --> undefined electric cars can have grabby brakes as  1448.799 --> undefined the first part of your braking is using  1450.76 --> undefined the regen its just smooth smooth smooth  1453.799 --> undefined one of the key problems with this car is  1456.08 --> undefined parking it in a parking Bay because its  1458.799 --> undefined rather huge can I even get in here I  1462 --> undefined think I  1463.76 --> undefined can now Im staying quite a bit away  1466.08 --> undefined from that curb cuz I dont want to curb  1467.72 --> undefined it obviously but then I think the issue  1470.559 --> undefined Im going to have is if someone gets out  1472.72 --> undefined of that vehicle theyre going to dig my  1474.399 --> undefined door and if I try and get out of  1477.919 --> undefined this oh dear Ive ding that door you  1481.12 --> undefined literally cant get out and wait the  1483.559 --> undefined door system works makes it hard you  1485.36 --> undefined cant like put your hand around it to  1486.799 --> undefined get to it so what you have to do is be a  1490.159 --> undefined little bit selfish everyones going to  1492.36 --> undefined hate on you guess you got to do what you  1493.84 --> undefined got to do when you got a cars as  1495.24 --> undefined expensive as this and paint workor that  1497.48 --> undefined will be quite expensive to repair  1499.88 --> undefined fortunately it wasnt the paint that hit  1502.36 --> undefined the door of that Land Cruiser the land  1504.72 --> undefined Cruisers ass so dont worry about it it  1506.159 --> undefined was this part here no marks on  1509.32 --> undefined that another great facet of this car is  1512 --> undefined its ability to just deal with speed  1514.08 --> undefined humps not a problem if I didnt see it I  1516.64 --> undefined wouldnt know it was  1518.52 --> undefined there that that was insane I didnt feel  1521.72 --> undefined it actually dropped down its like it  1523.32 --> undefined just lowered its suspension for me how  1526.159 --> undefined can going over a speed H hump be so just  1528.679 --> undefined damn pleasurable why do people buy  1531.039 --> undefined sports cars why have I got a GT3 RS this  1534.32 --> undefined is better I prefer driving this now  1537.24 --> undefined lets see how this Rolls-Royce Spectre  1539.159 --> undefined is transitioning from cruising very  1541.72 --> undefined slowly in town to accelerating up to  1544.08 --> undefined speed remember we got 584 horsepower so  1546.96 --> undefined it should go pretty well 3 2  1549.559 --> undefined 1  1551.279 --> undefined yep I think the way to describe that in  1554.039 --> undefined Rolls-Royce terms would be adequate  1557.24 --> undefined progress efficient progress maybe more  1560 --> undefined than adequate its sufficient you dont  1562.159 --> undefined need more and its exactly as much as  1565 --> undefined you ever need so this car is clearly  1567.12 --> undefined super relaxing but does it get a bit  1569.159 --> undefined stressful when you encounter some  1571.48 --> undefined Corners cuz of all that weight  1574.32 --> undefined well o no it doesnt so this car hides  1578.159 --> undefined its weight pretty well so that Tech  1580.12 --> undefined which stops it leaning in the bends  1581.64 --> undefined really does help so does the low center  1583.279 --> undefined of gravity with those you know heavy  1584.84 --> undefined batteries as low down as possible in the  1586.72 --> undefined car just means that it stays pretty flat  1588.919 --> undefined through the turns if youre going really  1590.6 --> undefined quickly the front tires will become  1592.399 --> undefined overwhelmed and itll push on but if  1594.159 --> undefined youre sticking to the speed limits its  1595.96 --> undefined absolutely fine and of course you got  1598.08 --> undefined four-wheel drive traction so you can get  1599.679 --> undefined your power down instantly to get you out  1602.039 --> undefined the bendz now what I can do is go one  1605.32 --> undefined pedal drive like this pressed it into B  1607.399 --> undefined mode and itll actually come to a  1608.76 --> undefined complete stop so you can drive on the  1611.96 --> undefined accelerator alone if you want to but  1613.88 --> undefined that doesnt suit this car because as  1615.32 --> undefined soon as you lift off the accelerator you  1617.12 --> undefined do get some pretty strong regen braking  1619.96 --> undefined which isnt very Rolls-Royce whereas if  1622.08 --> undefined youre just in normal mode it pretty  1623.72 --> undefined much coasts just a little bit of regen  1626 --> undefined breaking to mimic the engine braking you  1628.559 --> undefined get from one of their normal v12s with  1630.919 --> undefined an automatic gearbox but obviously the  1633.48 --> undefined response from the electric motors is  1635.36 --> undefined more immediate than you can get from the  1637.2 --> undefined V12 engine rollsroyce says the Spectre  1639.72 --> undefined will do n 60 in 4.5 seconds Im I test  1642.679 --> undefined it for myself using my specialist timing  1644.48 --> undefined gear to launch it theres no launch  1646.2 --> undefined control its a rollsroyce you just floor  1647.799 --> undefined the throttle like this 3 2 1  1652.559 --> undefined go that is Progressive thrust its not  1655.6 --> undefined brutal but nor 6 4.52 seconds here comes  1659.679 --> undefined the 100 mph Mark 9.99 beats the 10  1662.88 --> undefined seconds whats the4 mile 12.81%  1678.399 --> undefined test from 60 MPH see how long it takes  1680.88 --> undefined to stop its a big heavy car 2.9 tons  1683.6 --> undefined what is it going to be like at stopping  1687.159 --> undefined now little bit of ABS but you hardly  1689.679 --> undefined notice it it deals with it so well now I  1692.2 --> undefined want to beat 35 M anything under 35 M  1695 --> undefined will be good my figures are in feet so  1697.48 --> undefined 108 ft lets get the old conversion up  1701.399 --> undefined 33 M thats really impressive this thing  1704.64 --> undefined delivers performance but in a very  1706.519 --> undefined Rolls-Royce kind of way while I do think  1708.96 --> undefined that being electric makes the Spectre  1710.88 --> undefined quieter and smoother you got to remember  1713.44 --> undefined that this is a luxury item and a bit  1716.08 --> undefined like a watch with a proper mechanical  1719.039 --> undefined movement is a luxury good I kind of  1721.6 --> undefined think that the V12 engines just feel a  1724.2 --> undefined bit more luxurious reason being you can  1726.76 --> undefined just appreciate the engineering that  1728.919 --> undefined goes into them no one else can make an  1731.72 --> undefined engine as smooth as rolls-royces V12 I  1734.88 --> undefined mean you can rev it with a coin on it  1736.36 --> undefined and it wont even fall over its insane  1739.12 --> undefined whereas making an electric motor quiet  1743.2 --> undefined and smooth anyone can do it its not so  1745.44 --> undefined special theres another thing as well if  1747.64 --> undefined this did have a V12 in it it would  1749.36 --> undefined probably go as far on a full tank as  1750.919 --> undefined this one will go on a full battery the  1752.679 --> undefined only difference being that to fill it  1754.36 --> undefined back up again will take a lot longer  1756.039 --> undefined than this and if you can afford a  1757.6 --> undefined Rolls-Royce Spectre time is obviously  1759.919 --> undefined money so then should you avoid this car  1762.36 --> undefined should you consider it should you short  1763.72 --> undefined list it or should you just go right  1765.32 --> undefined ahead and buy it well I almost want to  1768.76 --> undefined say go right ahead and bik cuz I  1770.2 --> undefined absolutely love it but Id love it even  1773.32 --> undefined more if it had a V12 engine so for me  1777.84 --> undefined its actually not my favorite  1779.24 --> undefined Rolls-Royce I hope you enjoyed the video  1781.24 --> undefined if you did give it a like let me know  1782.76 --> undefined what you think of it in the comments  1783.72 --> undefined below if you want to watch some more  1784.919 --> undefined videos I picked a couple out for you  1786.12 --> undefined there I think youll like just click on  1787.399 --> undefined those windows to watch them or if you  1789.279 --> undefined havent done so already make sure you  1790.799 --> undefined subscribe to this channel you can do  1792.519 --> undefined that just by hitting the Carwell logo  1794.279 --> undefined there simple\n"

a  6.48 --> undefined match made in heaven you see what youve  8.36 --> undefined got there is the luxury of Rolls-Royce  10.639 --> undefined combined with silent effortless  12.799 --> undefined luxurious electric propulsion or could  15.08 --> undefined it work out a little bit more like when  16.68 --> undefined Brad Pit hooked up with Angelina Jolie  19.08 --> undefined and turned into a bit of a disaster well  21.56 --> undefined in this video were going to find out  22.68 --> undefined whether the rollsroyce Spectre is more  24.359 --> undefined Posh and Beck or brangelina now to do  26.76 --> undefined that what Im going to do is check out  28.279 --> undefined the exterior design  30.599 --> undefined talk you through the interior so thats  32.279 --> undefined a shame see how practical it is sorry  34.8 --> undefined Rolls-Royce please let me a car again  36.84 --> undefined Im going to tell you whats good about  38 --> undefined this car whats not so good about this  40.719 --> undefined car its a little bit soft Im going to  42.52 --> undefined take it for a drive everyones going to  44.239 --> undefined hate me and of course Im going to  45.6 --> undefined

well yeah Im out  53.32 --> undefined Watson youre watching  57.48 --> undefined carwow lets start this video by talking  59.719 --> undefined about the design of the Rolls-Royce  61.399 --> undefined Spectre its a wide car but they havent  63.719 --> undefined overdone it with design features very  66.2 --> undefined simplistic very elegant I really like  68.64 --> undefined the look of these protruding tail lipes  71.479 --> undefined less get on the fact that they have  73.119 --> undefined condensation in them lets see if the  74.799 --> undefined other one does as  77.24 --> undefined well oh dear lets lets move on around  79.52 --> undefined the side quick quick quick quick quick  80.759 --> undefined anyhow got to say this OB paint looks  83.119 --> undefined amazing or they wouldnt be everyones  84.96 --> undefined cup of tea I like it though I like the  86.72 --> undefined big wheels as well they start at 22 in  89.28 --> undefined these are the 23s and I love  91.439 --> undefined rolls-royces thick center cap so they  93.799 --> undefined actually stay upright when the car is  95.64 --> undefined driving along now just check it out  97.88 --> undefined inside profile it looks beautiful and  100.68 --> undefined huge it measures 5 1/2 M long and I love  104.36 --> undefined the coach line so this is painted by  106.719 --> undefined Human by hand and just check this out  108.84 --> undefined check this out that lines up perfectly  111.64 --> undefined absolutely  113.04 --> undefined perfectly its insane love the shiny  115.52 --> undefined bits of trim around the windows these  117.56 --> undefined are the biggest doors on any rolls look  120.2 --> undefined at that absolutely  121.92 --> undefined massive and if you want you can have  124 --> undefined this silver Bonnet its quite nice with  125.6 --> undefined the silver Bonnet at the front here you  127.479 --> undefined have the daytime running lights on top  129.319 --> undefined the main headlight unit below I think  131.56 --> undefined that was a design feature that was first  133.56 --> undefined started on the citrum Picasso MPV but  136.12 --> undefined looks really good on this rolls and you  137.76 --> undefined got the widest Grill of any Rolls-Royce  139.92 --> undefined and oh  141.319 --> undefined yes thats actually hurting my fingers  143.599 --> undefined because thats real authentic metal not  146.28 --> undefined like a fake metal grill that you get on  148.36 --> undefined a Bentley  151.84 --> undefined what is fake though is this you dont  153.4 --> undefined need that Grill look car stick of truth  156.04 --> undefined I just put it in there quite gingerly  157.48 --> undefined there we go look its blanked out behind  161 --> undefined there the grill isnt grilling the  163.48 --> undefined actual cooling of the battery and stuff  164.8 --> undefined is done through some vents in there  166.4 --> undefined which can open and close when the  167.8 --> undefined batteries need cooling speaking of which  170.36 --> undefined its absolutely huge the battery pack on  172.08 --> undefined this car weighs in over 700 Kos which  174.4 --> undefined means that even though this is like a  176 --> undefined coupe Rolls-Royce its almost 250 kg  179.36 --> undefined heavier than the massive Rolls-Royce  181.56 --> undefined Phantom 4 seater limousine its also got  183.64 --> undefined a very massive charging port flap and I  185.84 --> undefined would have thought that maybe it would  187.799 --> undefined have been like electrically operated  189.76 --> undefined rather than having to operate it by hand  191.2 --> undefined to open  192.92 --> undefined it anyway that brings me onto the  194.92 --> undefined battery itself the Spectre has a usable  197.4 --> undefined battery capacity of 102 KW hours and  200.319 --> undefined according to Rolls-Royce thats good  201.72 --> undefined enough for a range of 329 miles but I  204.68 --> undefined wanted to test that out for myself so I  206.48 --> undefined fully charged the car and the trip  207.879 --> undefined computer said that will give me a range  209.319 --> undefined of 2 271 Mi anyway Im barked on my  212.68 --> undefined journey and it took me 261 Mi and I  215.48 --> undefined still had 11 M of range remaining which  217.599 --> undefined meant a total possible of 272 M on a  220.959 --> undefined full charge so it means that trick  222.64 --> undefined computer is pretty accurate and that I  224.4 --> undefined achieved 83% of rolls-royces claimed  227.36 --> undefined range however things arent that simple  229.04 --> undefined with these electric cars you see while  231.239 --> undefined the trick computer may get to a point  232.72 --> undefined where it says youre out of range with  234 --> undefined no Mars remaining you do often have  235.76 --> undefined about 10 or so extra Mars available as a  238.879 --> undefined safety net so if I was to include those  242 --> undefined you could say this call do over like 280  244.4 --> undefined miles on a full charge before it will  246.319 --> undefined concave and in fact when you look at my  248.28 --> undefined average energy consumption of 2.8 m per  250.879 --> undefined kwatt hour multiply that up by the  252.48 --> undefined battery of 102 kwatt hours then youre  254.56 --> undefined looking at a real world possible range  256.28 --> undefined of about  257.28 --> undefined 286 Mi and interestingly the trick  259.84 --> undefined computer is now saying 291 Mi on a full  262.68 --> undefined charge also I should point out that most  264.4 --> undefined of my miles were done a Motorway speeds  266.84 --> undefined where electric cars arent that  268.24 --> undefined efficient so its not completely  269.72 --> undefined plausible that this car should be able  271.039 --> undefined to break the 300 M Mark if youre very  273.4 --> undefined very careful when driving it welcome to  275.52 --> undefined the inside of the Rolls-Royce Spectre  277.199 --> undefined and the first thing I want to show you  278.16 --> undefined is this the car is the very first  279.639 --> undefined Rolls-Royce to have fully digital dials  281.759 --> undefined but I think theyve done them in a very  283 --> undefined sympathetic way that looks lovely  285.199 --> undefined doesnt it now youve got a main  286.4 --> undefined infotainment screen here which is based  288.16 --> undefined on the BMW system its reasonably easy  290.52 --> undefined to  291.28 --> undefined navigate its absolutely fine and then  293.88 --> undefined moving over here theres something you  295 --> undefined dont get on a BMW and its the special  297.639 --> undefined Spectre graphic here and that this of  300.039 --> undefined like Galaxy thing going on now this  302.08 --> undefined isnt painted on these are loads of  303.479 --> undefined little holes that are like punched  304.96 --> undefined through some wood and behind there you  307.28 --> undefined have some lights so its actually  309.039 --> undefined illuminated that is insane to whats  311.759 --> undefined also insane look at  313.36 --> undefined this thats solid metal their events  316.8 --> undefined feels so so expensive so do all the  319.199 --> undefined switches and buttons oh yeah thats  322.16 --> undefined satisfying Everything feels really nice  324.4 --> undefined to move and to  326.16 --> undefined touch wait a minute whats that apart  329.24 --> undefined from that oh no whats going on there so  331.24 --> undefined thats a shame so this is a real cheap  333.52 --> undefined feeding bit of plastic the kind of thing  334.96 --> undefined youd expect to find on something like a  336.4 --> undefined daa not a Rolls Roy they tried to cover  338.72 --> undefined it up a bit by putting leather on the  341.039 --> undefined stalk and stitching it it doesnt really  343.24 --> undefined work cuz you dont touch that part you  344.6 --> undefined touch that part and actually the leather  346.24 --> undefined makes it look like something a little  347.8 --> undefined bit rude that Im not going to  349.479 --> undefined mention theres another cheap feeling  351.56 --> undefined bit of material in here and its the  352.96 --> undefined vanity  354.52 --> undefined mirror everything else is just lovely  356.96 --> undefined like the diffuse light from there this  358.8 --> undefined the grab handle the lighting area up  361.4 --> undefined here everything else that you touch its  364.36 --> undefined just so gorgeous and special feeling me  367.88 --> undefined I love it I love the door handles up  369.919 --> undefined here and like the metal strip that you  371.599 --> undefined get and you just touch that as you  373.759 --> undefined reaching the door handle it just adds a  375.599 --> undefined feeling of luxury quality to this car  378.88 --> undefined one thing I find quite weird though is  380.12 --> undefined that you sit really quite low in it  382.16 --> undefined makes me feel short because the dash is  384.599 --> undefined quite tall and quite Bluff upright now  387.24 --> undefined you can of course jack up your sink  389.12 --> undefined quite a long  390.479 --> undefined way I thought that the actual electric  393.44 --> undefined motors in the seats would be a bit  394.599 --> undefined quieter see as this is a Rolls-Royce I  396.68 --> undefined me just check the windows thats better  398.919 --> undefined thats quiet the electric window motor  400.84 --> undefined is definitely quiet yeah like that you  404.28 --> undefined can also move the steering wheel of  408.12 --> undefined course thats not so quiet either is it  411.96 --> undefined h oh well lets check out storage spaces  415.96 --> undefined oh yeah this is all lined with thought  417.56 --> undefined it feels nice you got wiress charging  419.039 --> undefined there USB VCS and 12vt socket it EDG  421.8 --> undefined down there theres a little place here  423.919 --> undefined for your keys you got the controller  426.72 --> undefined there for the infotainment system if  428.36 --> undefined youd rather rotate and push rather than  430.599 --> undefined touchy touchy on the screen back to the  432.879 --> undefined storage you got your cup holders there  434.96 --> undefined and just look at the damping on this oh  438.08 --> undefined that feels so solid and expensive really  441.28 --> undefined really nice lets check out the glove  444.24 --> undefined box oh nicely damped as well its not  447.56 --> undefined the biggest but its large enough  450.319 --> undefined oh I just have another G  452.96 --> undefined that as for the door  455.08 --> undefined bins well they not the largest I do have  459.56 --> undefined a bottle in here and let me just see if  461.52 --> undefined I can get a larger  464.12 --> undefined bottle cuz rollsroyce drivers still want  466.599 --> undefined to drink there we go look you can fit a  468.68 --> undefined large bottle in there I take it all back  472.28 --> undefined decent  473.319 --> undefined size can it fit the larger  475.96 --> undefined bottle this is make or break for  477.919 --> undefined Rolls-Royce oh yeah there we go this  480.28 --> undefined cars bound to be a roaring success now  483.919 --> undefined potential customers have breathed a sigh  486.24 --> undefined of relief there is one problem I  487.8 --> undefined actually find with these door bins you  489.039 --> undefined probably noticed it then they go back a  490.96 --> undefined little way so theres been a few times  493 --> undefined that Ive been out in this car and Ive  494.44 --> undefined like looked down there my wallet in  496 --> undefined there no its not and I got out the car  498.039 --> undefined then I realized my wallet isnt with me  499.36 --> undefined so then I have to come back and just  500.56 --> undefined check down back there look look look  502.639 --> undefined look let me show you look  504.8 --> undefined phone can you see my phone no you cant  506.919 --> undefined its gone in it its disappeared no  508.36 --> undefined phone in there its all the way back  510.599 --> undefined there oh do you know what can you hear  513.159 --> undefined that noise Ive just hit the button to  515.44 --> undefined activate the seat massaging in fact  517.08 --> undefined theres so many options on this car in  518.88 --> undefined terms of seat massaging you can massage  520.839 --> undefined your lower legs your back your buttocks  524.039 --> undefined you can also alter all the heating of  525.64 --> undefined the steering wheel and the armrests and  527.6 --> undefined you can alter how the seating actually  529.04 --> undefined warms your body whether its more on  530.48 --> undefined your legs or more on your back its  531.88 --> undefined quite incredible really in fact the  533.519 --> undefined ability to completely Speck this car up  535.399 --> undefined and make it completely bespoke for  537.16 --> undefined yourself is also incredible so if you  538.959 --> undefined dont like this this kind of obene cream  541.92 --> undefined I do actually you can go for something  543.64 --> undefined completely different maybe louder maybe  545.519 --> undefined less in your face one last thing I want  547.12 --> undefined to show you its the doors so to open  549.68 --> undefined the door I pull that and itll open  551.68 --> undefined there and then to actually open it  553 --> undefined further I pull again and it opens  555.48 --> undefined electrically though you do have to hold  557.48 --> undefined the handle so that it doesnt  558.6 --> undefined automatically open into a passer by to  561.16 --> undefined shut it I just press on the brake like  563.12 --> undefined this look B come  566.04 --> undefined on now if I wanted to do it differently  568.399 --> undefined I could just pull up on this switch and  569.8 --> undefined Ill show you now by shutting the  571.76 --> undefined passenger door without having to reach  573.64 --> undefined across tole  576.48 --> undefined pip one other thing I want to show you  578.399 --> undefined about the doors is look you got  580.88 --> undefined frameless  583.279 --> undefined Windows  585.079 --> undefined a thats just so cool go have a look  588.92 --> undefined from further away I love cars when you  591.56 --> undefined can put both windows down you dont have  593.68 --> undefined the frame dividing them Coupe now lets  596.72 --> undefined see what space is like here in the back  599.04 --> undefined of the Spectre obviously its a twodo  602.12 --> undefined coupe so you have to move the front  603.88 --> undefined passenger seat out of the  605.48 --> undefined way yeah as twodo Coupes go its not  608.959 --> undefined particularly difficult to get into the  610.2 --> undefined rear I think if you were on the large  612.68 --> undefined side you might struggle but adults will  614.64 --> undefined be okay check out knee room so this seat  617.12 --> undefined will go back to my driving position knee  619.16 --> undefined room is fine foot space come look at the  621.44 --> undefined foot space thats really good as well  624.76 --> undefined and  626 --> undefined Headroom its a bit tight people over  628.079 --> undefined six foot might struggle but I do like  629.839 --> undefined the fact that these seat backs are quite  631.24 --> undefined reclined so its comfy back here and  633.12 --> undefined like in the front its just a luxurious  635.48 --> undefined place to be with all the you know shiny  637.88 --> undefined bits and pieces the lovely bits of trim  640.16 --> undefined oh incidentally you can have this in a  642.279 --> undefined kind of Starry effect yeah we got some  644.639 --> undefined storage into here which is a good job  647.32 --> undefined because there are no door bins at all  649.519 --> undefined you got your two USB Cs there for  651.839 --> undefined charging your mobile phones we got cup  654.24 --> undefined holders under here oh that feels  656.44 --> undefined expensive yes lovely cup holders and  659.079 --> undefined then you got your climate control  660.44 --> undefined buttons here and  662.399 --> undefined more metalness comfortable enough for a  665.32 --> undefined twodo coupe oh and look got ice fix  668.8 --> undefined anger points there now I actually fitted  671 --> undefined a babysit into this car and it was easy  673.04 --> undefined enough to get it in the problem was  675.279 --> undefined trying to get to the eyes fix ankle  677.44 --> undefined points because these flaps are slightly  679.8 --> undefined offset to the middle so you end up  681.76 --> undefined stretching the flaps not to get to the  684.48 --> undefined actual mounting point but my little  686.399 --> undefined daughter Grace absolutely loved  688.079 --> undefined traveling in the back of this rolls  689.639 --> undefined though she has left her mark look grubby  692.959 --> undefined child por prints I think that if she was  696.279 --> undefined a bit older she might have gotten her  697.92 --> undefined mothers nerves a bit by pressing this  699.8 --> undefined button here really handy for adults but  702.8 --> undefined children might use it to just alter the  704.48 --> undefined seating position of their parents like  706.24 --> undefined that there you go you know thats going  708.68 --> undefined to happen now lets check out the boot  710.959 --> undefined you have 380 L of space and to put that  714.6 --> undefined into context a Volkswagen golfs boot is  716.88 --> undefined the same size obviously with the  718.6 --> undefined Volkswagen Golf you have the added  719.88 --> undefined practicality of been able to fold the  721.16 --> undefined seats down which you cant in here still  726.32 --> undefined you do have it lined with lovely carpet  729.8 --> undefined and I think its large enough to fit a  731.399 --> undefined man in it  733.48 --> undefined man be careful not to scratch the paint  736.76 --> undefined workor go  741.44 --> undefined on do you reckon theres room for me in  744.12 --> undefined there uh yeah thats Id rather there  748.36 --> undefined wasnt but might be D that sounded  751.399 --> undefined Sinister um do I can fit in there as  754 --> undefined well how are we going to do this top to  757.16 --> undefined tail sorry Rolls-Royce please let me a  759.8 --> undefined car  760.28 --> undefined [Music]  761.639 --> undefined again Louis and you can shut the what  764.959 --> undefined Im not sure this is the right way round  766.959 --> undefined especially if you  768.32 --> undefined fart go for it  771.12 --> undefined leis J we going to  777.48 --> undefined fit oh  781.44 --> undefined it we fitted once that test complete you  784.04 --> undefined cant fit two men in there oh and  786.639 --> undefined actually yeah jump out a second James  789.92 --> undefined oh oh hold me  792.079 --> undefined legs right try not to SC the paint  797.6 --> undefined work watch yourself watch your belt on  800.56 --> undefined the the paint the shiny bits and dont  803.32 --> undefined forget your glasses actually very nice  805.839 --> undefined James right  807.56 --> undefined so thats where you have your storage  810 --> undefined cables and rubbish and mini  814.36 --> undefined cheddar I think theyre  816.8 --> undefined Graces its okay though because we do  818.959 --> undefined have some more storage in the front  821.56 --> undefined underneath here being an electric car  823.199 --> undefined you have a wonderful front boot its  826.079 --> undefined obviously under this rather expensive  827.68 --> undefined feeling metal cover up right oh wait a  831.639 --> undefined minute um doesnt look like its meant  833.48 --> undefined to be a front boot so looks like we got  836.56 --> undefined some more mini cheddar here  842.639 --> undefined I didnt put those there anyway that  844.279 --> undefined brings on to five annoying things about  846 --> undefined the Rolls-Royce Spectre sometimes when  848.44 --> undefined youre parked on a slight angle like I  850.6 --> undefined am now the door Motors wont work so you  852.88 --> undefined have to do it all manually  857.04 --> undefined and its a big old heavy door look its  860.8 --> undefined not operating when I press the brake to  862.199 --> undefined shut it let just try  866.48 --> undefined again no look door Drive restricted its  869.959 --> undefined not that much of an angle the climate  872.56 --> undefined control system in this car is a little  874.399 --> undefined bit quaint but you could say its  875.92 --> undefined Antiquated because rather than setting  877.92 --> undefined an exact temperature and the car just  879.639 --> undefined gets the car to that temperature for you  881.399 --> undefined you have this dial here so hotter or  884.24 --> undefined colder now in the front theyre split so  886.24 --> undefined you can mix and match the temperature  888.92 --> undefined the upper part of the car and the lower  890.959 --> undefined part the only thing is though it doesnt  892.92 --> undefined actually work that well if you have like  894.92 --> undefined upper hot and lower cold you never  897.32 --> undefined really get the top half hot and a top  899.44 --> undefined half cold likewise the other way around  901.44 --> undefined if you really want it very hot or very  902.92 --> undefined cold you do have to slide them both  904.72 --> undefined together I mean I should be thankful  906.199 --> undefined that we dont have buttons all p in the  908.56 --> undefined menu on the screen but it just doesnt  910.639 --> undefined work that well for me and then theres  912.12 --> undefined the blower fan speed because yes I know  914.32 --> undefined they probably want diffuse air in a  916.72 --> undefined Rolls-Royce but yeah look at that its a  919.48 --> undefined little bit soft sometimes you just want  921.32 --> undefined to be blown hard and this car wont do  923.199 --> undefined it for you rolls-royces are all about  925.399 --> undefined luxury and comfort and again that extra  926.959 --> undefined mile to make their car seem more refined  928.759 --> undefined than any other normal vehicle yet they  930.92 --> undefined somehow havent managed to fix the  932.6 --> undefined creaky brakes that you get on many  933.88 --> undefined electric cars especially from the rear  936.36 --> undefined brakes I listen to this it does it just  938 --> undefined the same as the cheapest electric  944.12 --> undefined car you shouldnt have it on a  945.759 --> undefined Rolls-Royce I can just about accept it  948 --> undefined on some cheap daer spring or something  950.24 --> undefined like that but a rollsroyce come on you  953.44 --> undefined got some very thick windscreen pillars  955.36 --> undefined which do create a bit of a blind spot  959.36 --> undefined but thats not the worst bit because you  961.399 --> undefined sit quite low that plus the position of  963.959 --> undefined these rather large door mirrors do  966.199 --> undefined create a worst blind spot and Ive  967.92 --> undefined noticed its really problematic when  969.24 --> undefined youre approaching a roundabout and you  970.6 --> undefined want to filter straight onto it but you  972.16 --> undefined need to look to your right to make sure  973.319 --> undefined theres no cars coming from the side so  975.639 --> undefined have a look at this Im going to  977.319 --> undefined disappear ready Ive gone where am I  980.72 --> undefined nowhere to be seen absolutely nowhere to  982.72 --> undefined be seen Im actually here hello hello  986.8 --> undefined crazy many electric cars in emit a  989.44 --> undefined synthetic noise to make it for the fact  991.279 --> undefined they dont have a normal engine noise  993.44 --> undefined and this Rolls-Royce is no different  995.12 --> undefined theyre not convinced by the noise that  997.24 --> undefined Rolls-Royce have gone for  1000.18 --> undefined [Music]  1003.16 --> undefined listen its the kind of noise that they  1005.44 --> undefined use in thriller movies just before  1008.199 --> undefined something bad is about to happen so it  1010.6 --> undefined sort of makes it feel a bit tense which  1013 --> undefined is the exact opposite of what a  1015.16 --> undefined Rolls-Royce should be about at least you  1017.959 --> undefined can turn it off by pressing a button on  1019.68 --> undefined here and that brings on to five good  1021 --> undefined things about this car because there are  1022.44 --> undefined some noises I do like such as this the  1025.079 --> undefined indicator  1030.36 --> undefined click its like the tick of an expensive  1033.88 --> undefined clock the Lambs W mats in this car so  1036.72 --> undefined thick and luxurious oh kind of makes you  1039.16 --> undefined want to go barefoot though I wouldnt go  1040.919 --> undefined barefoot as a driver not for safety  1042.72 --> undefined reasons just because the design of the  1044.6 --> undefined mat for the driver sort of weirds me out  1047.64 --> undefined Ive been staring at it thinking what  1048.919 --> undefined then what does that remind me of I dont  1050.4 --> undefined know what it is s of reminds me of a  1052.2 --> undefined gorilla bare chest that a gorilla has  1054.12 --> undefined and theyre like furry elsewhere  1055.72 --> undefined definitely  1061.24 --> undefined is for the Spectre Rolls-Royce have now  1063.799 --> undefined redesigned the spirit of ecstasy of is  1065.919 --> undefined slightly hello how you doing her wings  1067.559 --> undefined are now slightly more back swept to  1069.64 --> undefined reduce drag cuz every bit helps an  1071.6 --> undefined electric car its also illuminated  1073.72 --> undefined though you cant see it in the daylight  1074.88 --> undefined so come and have a look down my top  1076.72 --> undefined sounds Sinister but there we go have a  1078.28 --> undefined look can you see get in  1081.2 --> undefined there its a bit rude is it oh oh get  1084.24 --> undefined out you filthy bugger do you see that  1087.24 --> undefined also as before another Rolls-Royce  1089.039 --> undefined products you can make the spirit go away  1092.6 --> undefined you can make it  1094.32 --> undefined return and of course if some grubby  1097.32 --> undefined Thief tries to steal  1099.44 --> undefined it that happens you can get the car with  1102.2 --> undefined rolls-royces famous Starlight headliner  1104.799 --> undefined so it has over 5,000 individual LEDs and  1108 --> undefined you can have any Star constellation you  1109.96 --> undefined want so a lot of people would choose the  1111.76 --> undefined one over wherever their main residences  1114.52 --> undefined I say main cuz obviously theyre going  1115.559 --> undefined to have a few properties this one is  1117.4 --> undefined apparently the constellation over the  1119.36 --> undefined Goodwood Factory one of the cool things  1121.559 --> undefined about this is that you get these  1122.88 --> undefined occasional shooting stars and theyre  1125 --> undefined really handy if you got young children  1127.12 --> undefined you see I went on a long journey in this  1128.64 --> undefined cold my daughter Grace and instead of  1130.52 --> undefined having to play I Spy for the entire  1132.48 --> undefined journey I just got to play a game shout  1134.679 --> undefined out when you see a shooting star and it  1137.2 --> undefined kept to entertain the whole way P rolls  1139.84 --> undefined the specters cameras sensors and satinav  1142.84 --> undefined data is linked to its suspension so when  1144.64 --> undefined youre driving down the road it can  1145.84 --> undefined gauge the surface and if it needs to  1147.72 --> undefined slacken off the dampers to make it just  1149.76 --> undefined absorb the bump a little bit better also  1152.2 --> undefined it can decouple its anti-roll bars when  1153.88 --> undefined youre going straight so that they dont  1155.52 --> undefined cause the car to rock from side to side  1157.4 --> undefined when you go over a bump and when you go  1158.76 --> undefined into a corner theyll lock back up again  1160.76 --> undefined so it keeps it nice and flat in the  1162.12 --> undefined bends and also it can alter the damping  1164.44 --> undefined and air suspension on each side of the  1165.76 --> undefined car to keep it nice and flat through the  1167.2 --> undefined turns and well find out exactly how all  1169.12 --> undefined of that works now to take it for a drive  1171.48 --> undefined want to sell your car quickly easily and  1173.72 --> undefined for a fair price then head to car while  1175.88 --> undefined to have over 4,000 trusted dealers ready  1178.84 --> undefined to bid on it in an online auction first  1181.52 --> undefined enter your cars registration to get an  1183.52 --> undefined instant approximate valuation then if  1186.24 --> undefined you want to proceed give us some more  1188.12 --> undefined details and upload some photos and well  1190.4 --> undefined help you set a fair reserve price for  1192.2 --> undefined your car thats the minimum amount youd  1194.159 --> undefined be happy to sell it for once youve done  1196.159 --> undefined that well enter your car into an online  1198.32 --> undefined auction when the auctions over well  1200.28 --> undefined let you know the result and the dealer  1201.84 --> undefined with the winning bid will be in touch to  1203.6 --> undefined arrange easy payment and free collection  1206.28 --> undefined of your car 93% of sellers surveyed said  1210.28 --> undefined they got the price they expected or more  1212.919 --> undefined through carwow the best bit is its  1216.799 --> undefined completely free I put a link in the  1219.36 --> undefined description of this video and the Ping  1221.36 --> undefined comment to take you directly to carw  1223.84 --> undefined where over 4,000 dealers are ready to  1226.679 --> undefined bid on your car or you can just click on  1228.84 --> undefined pop out Banner that should be appearing  1230.4 --> undefined in the top right hand corner of the  1231.559 --> undefined screen now alternatively just Google  1234.24 --> undefined help me carwow and we will help you sell  1236.919 --> undefined your car quickly easily and for a fair  1239.4 --> undefined price on with the video one of the  1241.08 --> undefined problems with driving something like  1242.6 --> undefined this Rolls-Royce BR smaller Villages is  1245.32 --> undefined the sheer width of it so its over 2 m  1248.4 --> undefined excluding the door mirror so people do  1250.64 --> undefined have to pull over to get out of your way  1253.039 --> undefined let me just bring up the cameras cuz I  1254.48 --> undefined do not want to  1256.799 --> undefined scrape oh this is not good but Im not  1259.28 --> undefined enjoying this you sit quite low as well  1261.88 --> undefined so the view out and KN where the corners  1264.799 --> undefined of the car are is a little bit tricky  1268.32 --> undefined okay well I do think Ive got away with  1270.48 --> undefined that by not having too many cars coming  1272.52 --> undefined in the other direction oh no wait for me  1276.799 --> undefined please Im in the Rolls-Royce thank you  1279.32 --> undefined fellow electric car driver Ill tell you  1281.559 --> undefined what though while there might be moments  1283.679 --> undefined of concern when driving through a  1285.64 --> undefined village most of the time its super  1287.52 --> undefined relaxing so quiet in here the suspension  1291 --> undefined is absolutely glorious this bit of road  1294.08 --> undefined is horrible really in terms of the  1296.4 --> undefined condition and yet this just just soaks  1300.44 --> undefined at the bumps lets get the parking thing  1302.52 --> undefined on see if I can find a parking space  1305.32 --> undefined there we go start reverse parking lets  1307.12 --> undefined see what it does in this situation is it  1309.48 --> undefined really going to do this or is it just  1310.919 --> undefined going to park it in the weirdest way  1312.919 --> undefined possible as it figured out that theres  1314.88 --> undefined a low curb  1319.12 --> undefined it  1320.919 --> undefined misinterpreted this as a parking bait  1323.799 --> undefined dont crash into the  1328.48 --> undefined wall I think its as bad at parking as  1331 --> undefined me this is just what it  1338.08 --> undefined doing yay thats perfectly fine I think  1341.88 --> undefined I better get out this space cuz Im sort  1343.48 --> undefined of blocking the road to be fair on this  1345.6 --> undefined rollsroyce it did spot that as a Bay  1347.679 --> undefined Park even though wasnt one and I did  1349.72 --> undefined select for it to go into the bay so my  1351.72 --> undefined fault not really the cars oh hello we  1354.559 --> undefined got Bay Park in here now it wants to Bay  1356.559 --> undefined Park in a here Ive got someone behind  1361.36 --> undefined me theyre not going to move oh they are  1363.72 --> undefined going to move sometimes people move for  1365.559 --> undefined rolls-royces oh Im causing chaos here  1367.72 --> undefined everyones very cross at me Im trying  1369.88 --> undefined to park the car shes really annoyed  1372.4 --> undefined dont know what shes going to do try  1373.6 --> undefined not to crash into the Rolls-Royce its  1375.279 --> undefined wanting to partk me here I cause chaos  1378.2 --> undefined again again everyones going to hate me  1380.4 --> undefined cant blame them right this is oh is not  1384.64 --> undefined happy I dont really know if this is a  1386.799 --> undefined good idea once again I chose to do that  1388.96 --> undefined it selected a space it wasnt the right  1390.72 --> undefined space I mean I guess I can sort of Park  1392.96 --> undefined here lets just get out of here so the  1394.799 --> undefined length of this thing does affect the  1396.4 --> undefined maneuverability even though I have rear  1398.919 --> undefined axle steering its not easy to do a  1402.159 --> undefined uturn in a car this size i normally do  1404.44 --> undefined it here but Im kind of a bit scuppered  1406.6 --> undefined by this van so lets just try it up  1408.72 --> undefined there so the Turning circles 12.7 M  1412.2 --> undefined lets see if we can get around here  1414.159 --> undefined definitely using my cameras will I get  1416.08 --> undefined backround again absolutely no bluming  1419.279 --> undefined chance Im doing all the wrong Maneuvers  1424.84 --> undefined here very close to that old perso and no  1429.72 --> undefined I give this car one thing it might be  1431.919 --> undefined big it might not have the best turning  1433.96 --> undefined Circle but my gosh its easy to turn  1436.72 --> undefined this steering wheel and normally if I  1439 --> undefined was getting into these kind of shenan  1440.4 --> undefined guns in any other car Id start to get a  1442.159 --> undefined little bit stressed but this car is so  1444.279 --> undefined relaxing I dont mind so much sometimes  1446.88 --> undefined electric cars can have grabby brakes as  1448.799 --> undefined the first part of your braking is using  1450.76 --> undefined the regen its just smooth smooth smooth  1453.799 --> undefined one of the key problems with this car is  1456.08 --> undefined parking it in a parking Bay because its  1458.799 --> undefined rather huge can I even get in here I  1462 --> undefined think I  1463.76 --> undefined can now Im staying quite a bit away  1466.08 --> undefined from that curb cuz I dont want to curb  1467.72 --> undefined it obviously but then I think the issue  1470.559 --> undefined Im going to have is if someone gets out  1472.72 --> undefined of that vehicle theyre going to dig my  1474.399 --> undefined door and if I try and get out of  1477.919 --> undefined this oh dear Ive ding that door you  1481.12 --> undefined literally cant get out and wait the  1483.559 --> undefined door system works makes it hard you  1485.36 --> undefined cant like put your hand around it to  1486.799 --> undefined get to it so what you have to do is be a  1490.159 --> undefined little bit selfish everyones going to  1492.36 --> undefined hate on you guess you got to do what you  1493.84 --> undefined got to do when you got a cars as  1495.24 --> undefined expensive as this and paint workor that  1497.48 --> undefined will be quite expensive to repair  1499.88 --> undefined fortunately it wasnt the paint that hit  1502.36 --> undefined the door of that Land Cruiser the land  1504.72 --> undefined Cruisers ass so dont worry about it it  1506.159 --> undefined was this part here no marks on  1509.32 --> undefined that another great facet of this car is  1512 --> undefined its ability to just deal with speed  1514.08 --> undefined humps not a problem if I didnt see it I  1516.64 --> undefined wouldnt know it was  1518.52 --> undefined there that that was insane I didnt feel  1521.72 --> undefined it actually dropped down its like it  1523.32 --> undefined just lowered its suspension for me how  1526.159 --> undefined can going over a speed H hump be so just  1528.679 --> undefined damn pleasurable why do people buy  1531.039 --> undefined sports cars why have I got a GT3 RS this  1534.32 --> undefined is better I prefer driving this now  1537.24 --> undefined lets see how this Rolls-Royce Spectre  1539.159 --> undefined is transitioning from cruising very  1541.72 --> undefined slowly in town to accelerating up to  1544.08 --> undefined speed remember we got 584 horsepower so  1546.96 --> undefined it should go pretty well 3 2  1549.559 --> undefined 1  1551.279 --> undefined yep I think the way to describe that in  1554.039 --> undefined Rolls-Royce terms would be adequate  1557.24 --> undefined progress efficient progress maybe more  1560 --> undefined than adequate its sufficient you dont  1562.159 --> undefined need more and its exactly as much as  1565 --> undefined you ever need so this car is clearly  1567.12 --> undefined super relaxing but does it get a bit  1569.159 --> undefined stressful when you encounter some  1571.48 --> undefined Corners cuz of all that weight  1574.32 --> undefined well o no it doesnt so this car hides  1578.159 --> undefined its weight pretty well so that Tech  1580.12 --> undefined which stops it leaning in the bends  1581.64 --> undefined really does help so does the low center  1583.279 --> undefined of gravity with those you know heavy  1584.84 --> undefined batteries as low down as possible in the  1586.72 --> undefined car just means that it stays pretty flat  1588.919 --> undefined through the turns if youre going really  1590.6 --> undefined quickly the front tires will become  1592.399 --> undefined overwhelmed and itll push on but if  1594.159 --> undefined youre sticking to the speed limits its  1595.96 --> undefined absolutely fine and of course you got  1598.08 --> undefined four-wheel drive traction so you can get  1599.679 --> undefined your power down instantly to get you out  1602.039 --> undefined the bendz now what I can do is go one  1605.32 --> undefined pedal drive like this pressed it into B  1607.399 --> undefined mode and itll actually come to a  1608.76 --> undefined complete stop so you can drive on the  1611.96 --> undefined accelerator alone if you want to but  1613.88 --> undefined that doesnt suit this car because as  1615.32 --> undefined soon as you lift off the accelerator you  1617.12 --> undefined do get some pretty strong regen braking  1619.96 --> undefined which isnt very Rolls-Royce whereas if  1622.08 --> undefined youre just in normal mode it pretty  1623.72 --> undefined much coasts just a little bit of regen  1626 --> undefined breaking to mimic the engine braking you  1628.559 --> undefined get from one of their normal v12s with  1630.919 --> undefined an automatic gearbox but obviously the  1633.48 --> undefined response from the electric motors is  1635.36 --> undefined more immediate than you can get from the  1637.2 --> undefined V12 engine rollsroyce says the Spectre  1639.72 --> undefined will do n 60 in 4.5 seconds Im I test  1642.679 --> undefined it for myself using my specialist timing  1644.48 --> undefined gear to launch it theres no launch  1646.2 --> undefined control its a rollsroyce you just floor  1647.799 --> undefined the throttle like this 3 2 1  1652.559 --> undefined go that is Progressive thrust its not  1655.6 --> undefined brutal but nor 6 4.52 seconds here comes  1659.679 --> undefined the 100 mph Mark 9.99 beats the 10  1662.88 --> undefined seconds whats the4 mile 12.81%  1678.399 --> undefined test from 60 MPH see how long it takes  1680.88 --> undefined to stop its a big heavy car 2.9 tons  1683.6 --> undefined what is it going to be like at stopping  1687.159 --> undefined now little bit of ABS but you hardly  1689.679 --> undefined notice it it deals with it so well now I  1692.2 --> undefined want to beat 35 M anything under 35 M  1695 --> undefined will be good my figures are in feet so  1697.48 --> undefined 108 ft lets get the old conversion up  1701.399 --> undefined 33 M thats really impressive this thing  1704.64 --> undefined delivers performance but in a very  1706.519 --> undefined Rolls-Royce kind of way while I do think  1708.96 --> undefined that being electric makes the Spectre  1710.88 --> undefined quieter and smoother you got to remember  1713.44 --> undefined that this is a luxury item and a bit  1716.08 --> undefined like a watch with a proper mechanical  1719.039 --> undefined movement is a luxury good I kind of  1721.6 --> undefined think that the V12 engines just feel a  1724.2 --> undefined bit more luxurious reason being you can  1726.76 --> undefined just appreciate the engineering that  1728.919 --> undefined goes into them no one else can make an  1731.72 --> undefined engine as smooth as rolls-royces V12 I  1734.88 --> undefined mean you can rev it with a coin on it  1736.36 --> undefined and it wont even fall over its insane  1739.12 --> undefined whereas making an electric motor quiet  1743.2 --> undefined and smooth anyone can do it its not so  1745.44 --> undefined special theres another thing as well if  1747.64 --> undefined this did have a V12 in it it would  1749.36 --> undefined probably go as far on a full tank as  1750.919 --> undefined this one will go on a full battery the  1752.679 --> undefined only difference being that to fill it  1754.36 --> undefined back up again will take a lot longer  1756.039 --> undefined than this and if you can afford a  1757.6 --> undefined Rolls-Royce Spectre time is obviously  1759.919 --> undefined money so then should you avoid this car  1762.36 --> undefined should you consider it should you short  1763.72 --> undefined list it or should you just go right  1765.32 --> undefined ahead and buy it well I almost want to  1768.76 --> undefined say go right ahead and bik cuz I  1770.2 --> undefined absolutely love it but Id love it even  1773.32 --> undefined more if it had a V12 engine so for me  1777.84 --> undefined its actually not my favorite  1779.24 --> undefined Rolls-Royce I hope you enjoyed the video  1781.24 --> undefined if you did give it a like let me know  1782.76 --> undefined what you think of it in the comments  1783.72 --> undefined below if you want to watch some more  1784.919 --> undefined videos I picked a couple out for you  1786.12 --> undefined there I think youll like just click on  1787.399 --> undefined those windows to watch them or if you  1789.279 --> undefined havent done so already make sure you  1790.799 --> undefined subscribe to this channel you can do  1792.519 --> undefined that just by hitting the Carwell logo  1794.279 --> undefined there simple\n",
